        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>It was a Saturday back in 2012, and we both decided to help out a mutual friend and attend her yoga class.
          There were only a handful of people in attendance, so it was pretty easy to spot each other from across the
          room. One week later, we were on our first date at the Library Ale House in Santa Monica where we bonded over
          fish tacos, craft beer, and witty banter. The rest is history! (Photo by Nathan Dumlao) </p>

        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>The proposal happened on a weekend trip to Carmel-by-the-Sea. We left home early in the morning, drove south
          for a few hours taking in the scenery. When we got to town we hit up a beautiful brunch spot and spent the day
          window shopping around town and taking in the gallery art.
          That afternoon we stopping into a wine and cheese shop. We love wine tasting so we bought wine to take down
          to the beach for sunset. I had no clue what he had planned or that my life was about to change forever.
          Just before sunset he got down on his knee and I said YES!</p>

        <p>Located just steps away from Union Square, the hotel is right by one of the city's iconic cable car lines,
          making it easy to hop aboard and explore numerous attractions including Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf and Pier

        <h3>Fairmont San Francisco</h3>
        <p>Beautiful hotel near all downtown attractions. Featuring the Tonga Room (as seen on No Reservations with
          Anthony Bourdain) it's a little pricey, but worth it!</p>
